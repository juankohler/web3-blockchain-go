# web3-blockchain-go
Blockchain example in Go: A hands-on project to explore the basics of blockchain technology.

## Simulation Logic
The `main.go` file includes the following logic:

1. **Create Blockchain**: The simulation starts by creating a new blockchain.
2. **Add Blocks**: Two blocks are added to the blockchain, each with custom data.
3. **Print the Blockchain**: The blockchain is printed to visualize its content.
4. **Validate the Blockchain**: The blockchain is validated to ensure there has been no tampering.
5. **Invalidate the Blockchain**: One of the blocks is intentionally altered to demonstrate how validation detects manipulation.

## How to Run the Project

To run the simulation, simply use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
